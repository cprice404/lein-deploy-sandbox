# lein-deploy-sandbox

This project was created to test out:

* Deploying artifacts to a local maven repository
* Setting this project's artifacts as a dependency for another project
* Using the `checkouts` feature to grab a local copy of the source for a dependency and have it override the binary version downloaded by leinengen.

Success on all fronts... see `lein-checkout-sandbox` project for more info.
